                Hi, I’m Callista Meyra Azizah from Surabaya. I’m majoring in Information Technology. Here are the works I did during Basic Media Schooling!

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Basics of Design</h3>
                <p>Here, we were taught the basics of designing like what shapes can be grouped together, what colour theory is (it’s like the rule of colours, like a mismatch kinda way).
                    Then, we were told to make a basic website landing page. With little to no experience in using Figma, I designed this silly little landing page which, as you can see, is like a basic introduction of myself (i used the template that was given by the mentor though).</p>

                <p>Here, we were taught the basics of programming a website, from HTML to CSS, we were thought bot of them. We also were thought on how to commit, push, etc by using our own VSCode, which was pretty cool. To the left, it is the website I coded during BMS’ Website section. Truth be told, it helped me know some of the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p>Here, we were taught the basics of how to do a copywriting. Creatively! It was a unique experience since we, of course, did a hands-on on the project.I felt like I was one of the copywriters since we filled someforms on google docs, sheets, etc. It was quite entertaining and quite fun for me.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Basics of Photography</h3>
                <p>Here, we were taught the basics of photography, from lightning, perspective, etc. We even had to practice photographing a person or animal or literally anything. We also got some constructive criticism based on what we took a pic.

                    Here, I photographed my friend, Tika. I used my phone and angled it to capture her fun yet calm personality. </p>
